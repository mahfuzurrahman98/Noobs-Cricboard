        <u><b>Noobs Cricboard</b></u> is a free and open-source web application that aims to replace the pan and paper
        score counting
        tradition for a running cricket match. It offers users to count the score, wickets, and player's stats to keep
        track of
        the
        match ball by ball.<br><br>

        This is a single page application developed using vannila javascript, bootstrap5 for designing the user
        interface.
        The system is still under development, some of the features still need to be added. It is released for beta
        testing. Contact me if you find any bug or if you have any suggestion.<br><br>
